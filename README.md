Welcome to MaraScott.AI nodes for ComfyUI.

So far, here is the list of developed nodes:

- [AnyBus Node AKA UniversalBus](#anybus-node-aka-universalbus-node) to easily manage a large number of splines in the workflow.
- [Upscale Refiner Node AKA McBoaty](#upscaler-refiner-node-aka-mcboaty-node) to upscale and refine an image for printing or any other purpose that might require a larger size.
- Display Info to display multiline text

# AnyBus Node AKA UniversalBus Node

The AnyBus Node (AKA UniversalBus Node) is designed to provide a Universal Bus Node (as some might say) based on AnyType Input/Output.

**Native Support**

You can assume that any node input/output works like "UE Nodes / Use Everywhere" Nodes.

**BUS Input/Output Support**

Bus Nodes can be connected from one AnyBus Node to another, and we support the following Reroute Nodes as long as they are linked from an AnyBus Node before connecting it to another.

Set/Get Node **Supported**:

- "SetNode" from ComfyUI-KJNodes
- "GetNode" from ComfyUI-KJNodes

Reroute Node **Supported**:

- "Reroute (rgthree)" from RgThree Custom Node

Reroute Node **Not Supported**:
- "Reroute" from ComfyUI native - reason: does not allow connection on Any Type if the origin Type is not Any Type too
- "ReroutePrimitive|pysssss" from Pysssss Custom Node - reason: does not display the name of the origin slot
- "0246.CastReroute" from 0246 Custom Node - reason: undefined behavior

Here is a very simple workflow:

What does it intend to do?

In the world of ComfyUI, the spaghetti workflow can quickly become a mess. I personally was confused at some point by the get/set approach, which brought me to develop this AnyBus Node applying a profile approach to organize different Buses in the same workflow.
One Bus has a maximum of 25 inputs/outputs (feel free to make an issue request for a higher maximum).

This AnyBus is dyslexia friendly :D

# Large Upscaler Refiner Node AKA McBoaty Node

The Upscaler Refiner Node (AKA McBoaty Node) is an upscaler coupled with a refiner to achieve higher rendering results.
The output image is a slightly modified image.
