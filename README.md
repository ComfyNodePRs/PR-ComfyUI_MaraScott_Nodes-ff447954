This is an attempt to provide a Universal Bus Node (as some might say) getting inspiration from different nodes and implementing some of my approach to the Bus Node behavior.

I would like to thanks the authors of [Was Node Suite](https://github.com/WASasquatch/was-node-suite-comfyui), KJNodes get/set, trung Highway, DrLtData, Confyanimous (I might have forgotten some others authors, please forgive me). 

A special thanks to Fern for his support.

Here a very simple workflow

What does it intend to do ?

In the world of ComfyUI, the spaghetti workflow can quickly become a mess, I personaly at some point was confused too by the get/set approach which brought me to develop this Bus Node applying a profile approach to organise different bus in same workflow.

on top of that it is dislexia friendly :D

What are the features ?

If anybody is interested to use it, I'm following on feature request.
